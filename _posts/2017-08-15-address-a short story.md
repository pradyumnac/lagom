![In the rains somewhere in Kolkata](https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/db/95/d7/db95d72d460cf583b966448a1423465a--rain-fall-rain-drops.jpg)

A gloomy, cold rainy day, it was. I was walking in the bylanes of central Kolkata. My mood as gloomy as ever.

The streets are logged with a copious amount of water. Water, Water everywhere. I reached for my bottle - half empty and took a sip. 

It has become a habit for me to take long walks. And by long, I mean really really long. What is a couple of miles for a young pair of feet. Sunny, it be or drenched - walking is that basic act of life that makes us alive and kicking. I stepped out ignoring my mom's warnings and reprimanding - beta, it will rain: It will rain hard today. Take your umbrella. She has long know better than to try stop me from stepping out. I ignored. But I did leave my cellphone behind out of fear that drenching it yet again. That leaves it unresponsive to touch. So I stepped out, out of my address they cal home.

Its pouring really hard now. Not a soul on the street. The pave ment drenched , the streets water logged as ever. Its become a habit for my city to never let go - if it pours , it stays and floods. The city has succummbed to a parasitic growth of inward migrations - people looking for jobs. But the infrustructure has barely been able to cope up. So it clings to what ever water it gets in its midst.

![A Rickshaw Puller in a cold rainign night](/http://www.myguesthouse.com/chaturyatri/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Kolkata-rains-001.jpg)

A rickshaw is approaching in the main streat. Its tyres half submerged. The puller has got a plastic sheet on top of his head but it is barely able to keep him dry. His sight is forward. Ignoring any passengers who might wish to stop it. In a frantci attemp, its wheels half submerged , the chariot of the puller is rushing towards its destination. Who knows where. Most posibly home where his wife and perhaps a choir of three hungry mouth awaits his homecoming.

for the last five minutes into my stroll, I have met no one outdoors save this poor drenched man. However, a thought kept lingering me - the eyes which arent there tries to fixate on another pair belonging to a fellow drenched soul. Someone is definitely out there. yet, when I turn aoundd, look about, I see no one, nothing save a drenched jungle of bricks and stones, some street lamps and occasional sign board with a false set of eyes. Billboards dont see, they dont hear. They only speak. They whisper in your ears. Promise of happiness untold, a dreams within your reach. An address of your own amist the luxuries of sprewing laws and gleaming pools. 

Who needs more water, more artificial patches of land. More hypocrisies of social pretensions, more and more pair of eyes that keep looking if you but step an unheeded stone that has not been  stepped for ages. They laugh, they scream, they shout , they network yet live in a promised dream world of unfullfilled expectations and need to be understood. Screw them! Screw Them All. 

I have my share of green patch beside me - The open meadows of a playground that occupy the left side of my path. The maidan - Kolkata largest stretch of grassy land that is yet to be engulfed by those never stopping ascension of concreete wall. Quier isnt it, lost in a train of thoughts, you pair of legs keeps falling step after step , taking you to unplanned places. Its like a dream but on when you wake up from you gushing steam of thought, you dont find yourself in your bed. Thats what I love about walking

Yet that feeling that there is someone out there right now watching me, that feeling - It can get out of the corner of my head. 

But then suddenly, When I turn back, I see a small pair of feet placed upon a small heap of ever so drenched  clothes. She was staring at me with a strange look of melancholy. A young girl. What! In the midst of this godforsaken downpour. Where are her parents? Wont she catch a cold in this rain?And how did she come at the mid of the pavement which I just passed? Was she follwing me then? I swear I did not see her when I tuned back a couple of times earlier..

I paced back a few steps to find out more..

"Hello, Little girl! Why are you in this rain? WHere are your parents? Are you lost?"

*Silence for a couple of moments. He holds her gaze.*

Its only now I notice how her face is weary of god knows what she has been through. Her eyes shrunken. Her face on the verge of tears - Of some untold tragedy. Yet I dont see her cry. Or is she indeed crying just now? Tears rlling down her cheek. Lost among the pour of a thousand drops from heaven above

"Where are you from, sweet one? Here, take my jacket."

She readly accepts while all throughout the time, never stopping to look at me. My jacket covers her from sholder to toe and then some. Its a windcheater cum sports jacket , I have. Light  but does not keep the rain  out. It cetrainly is better at providing some warmth in this cold shivering rain

I stand perplexed, look to my sides desperately tryting to find a couple of even a single soul from whom she has run ahead of. No one to be found.

*"What do I do?" Wher should I take her? Oh, There should he a police station hearby - Maindan police station. Perhaps they can help me and her find this girl's address"*

I lifted her in my arms. He drenched windcheater touching my now drenched tshirt. Ah. Cold it was that day!
