"Want some candy?" Said I, reaching into my pocket - my hand brushing against a cold wrapper of lollipop.

She took it from my hand, without a word. We are stolling, rather slowly in the rain towards the establishment that might just get her to her parents. 

The modern lamps with spiral of led strips are ablaze - a recent development in the missing story of the city's planned urbanisation. How unreal they look - three strands of metal with a glowing head each asking grace from someone above. This part of the city has become relatively clean if you can pardon the accumulated water - no more floating plastic wrappers around. She tucked in the wrapper in my windshell jacket, I noticed from the corner of the eye..
She seemed a bit too tired though rather happy with the snail like oace we are strolling. I wondered should I lift her up in my arms and a moment later thought against it. She seems to notice each step she take rather finding herself in the moment. Or was It me who was doing the same and projecting that onto her?

We reached the station - rather alive in lights as if an establishment that never sleeps. 

A couple of Jeep's like on their back at one side by the door, all too close to the building. Perhaps someone does not like getting wet after all

We entered the building, dripping over. A man, in his mid forties, presumably the constable, was not looking too pleased at our state. He looked at us and then the chair and at us, some more..

I lifted her up and say her at a side bench

"Namaste sir. I was walking by the road a couple of blocks back and I found her out in the open soaking in rain. No one else was anywhere to be seen. Can you please help me find her parents? She might be lost". I stood beside the chair in front of his desk. 

He looked up slowly and after a brief moment said: "Please take a seat"

I looked at her, she lost in thought. Or too tired, perhaps. I took the seat

"Naren, bring her a glass of hot mil from Ramu's". Naren, not too pleased on the course of action set upon him, looked at me. "Who the hell walks about in this God forsaken rain?" He murmured under his breath. I took out his XL size umbrella and stepped out. Apparently, he knew better than to dispute with his sir. 

"Where did you find her?"
